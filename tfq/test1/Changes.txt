Changes

   MouseUp is no longer called when the editbuffer is moused out of.
   You can hold space when clicking to use the panning tool.
   Likewise, you can hold shift for eraser.
   The line tool no longer leaves the hilight after drawing a line. (it clears)
   The line tool draws a 'full line' (before it would skip the last tile it needed to draw in the line)
   the "New buffer wizard" starts with default values for name, width, height, and tilesize.
   The map doesn't start off rendering dirt everywhere.
