Issues

	----no generalized render function in editbuffer, called everywhere, sometimes clears, sometimes don't.

	----setCell function is rendering the tilemap every time it's called, should optimize because the fill tools use it

	----better output information for camera position

	****shape and position of the toolbox

	----toolbox has unfinished tools

	----mouse moves out of the screen during checkpoints and releases! bugs!

	----EditorCore missing io functions

	Tilemap can't zoom yet

	io package is still full static

	----Input has no height option

	****Toolkit engine loads skin files; needs to load a single file that spcifies the skin file.

	----cfg file not parsed or used

	----some children panel type may have unremoved listeners after unloaded.

	----add functions binds to the functions in menu

	tool cursors

	----layout
